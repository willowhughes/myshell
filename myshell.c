* Runs the shell in an endless loop until an exit command is issued.

* Hint: Use getinput and processline as appropriate.

/*
* getinput
*
* Prompts the user for a line of input (e.g. %myshell%) and stores it in a dynamically
* allocated buffer (pointed to by *line).
* If input fits in the buffer, it is stored in *line.
* If the buffer is too small, *line is freed and a larger buffer is allocated.
* The size of the buffer is stored in *size.
*
* Args:
*   line: pointer to a char* that will be set to the address of the input buffer
*   size: pointer to a size_t that will be set to the size of the buffer *line or 0 if *line is NULL.
*
* Returns:
*   The length of the the string stored in *line.
*
* Hint: There is a standard i/o function that can make getinput easier than it sounds.

/*
* processline
*
* Interprets the input line as a command and either executes it as a built-in
* or forks a child process to execute an external program.
* Built-in commands are executed immediately.
* External commands are parsed then forked to be executed.
*
* Args:
*   line: string containing a shell command and arguments
*
* Note: There are three cases to consider when forking a child process:
*   1. Fork fails
*   2. Fork succeeds and this is the child process
*   3. Fork succeeds and this is the parent process
*
* Hint: See the man page for fork(2) for more information.
* Hint: The process should only fork when the line is not empty and not trying to
*       run a built-in command.
